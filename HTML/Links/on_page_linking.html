    <h1>Henrik Ibsen</h1>
    <p>Henrik Johan Ibsen (/ˈɪbsən/;[1] Norwegian: [ˈhɛnrɪk ˈɪpsn̩]; 20 March 1828 – 23 May 1906) was a Norwegian
        playwright, theatre director, and poet. As one of the founders of modernism in theatre, Ibsen is often referred
        to as "the father of realism" and one of the most influential playwrights of his time.[2] His major works
        include Brand, Peer Gynt, An Enemy of the People, Emperor and Galilean, A Doll's House, Hedda Gabler, Ghosts,
        The Wild Duck, When We Dead Awaken, Pillars of Society, The Lady from the Sea, Rosmersholm, The Master Builder,
        and John Gabriel Borkman. He is the most frequently performed dramatist in the world after Shakespeare,[3][4]
        and by the early 20th century A Doll's House became the world's most performed play.[5]

        Several of his later dramas were considered scandalous to many of his era, when European theatre was expected to
        model strict morals of family life and propriety. Ibsen's later work examined the realities that lay behind the
        façades, revealing much that was disquieting to a number of his contemporaries. He had a critical eye and
        conducted a free inquiry into the conditions of life and issues of morality. His early poetic and cinematic play
        Peer Gynt, however, has also strong surreal elements.[6]

        Ibsen is often ranked as one of the most distinguished playwrights in the European tradition.[7] Richard Hornby
        describes him as "a profound poetic dramatist—the best since Shakespeare".[8] He is widely regarded as the most
        important playwright since Shakespeare.[7][9] He influenced other playwrights and novelists such as George
        Bernard Shaw, Oscar Wilde, Arthur Miller, James Joyce, Eugene O'Neill, and Miroslav Krleža. Ibsen was nominated
        for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1902, 1903, and 1904.[10]

        Ibsen wrote his plays in Danish (the common written language of Denmark and Norway during his lifetime)[11] and
        they were published by the Danish publisher Gyldendal. Although most of his plays are set in Norway—often in
        places reminiscent of Skien, the port town where he grew up—Ibsen lived for 27 years in Italy and Germany, and
        rarely visited Norway during his most productive years. Born into a merchant family connected to the patriciate
        of Skien, Ibsen shaped his dramas according to his family background. He was the father of Prime Minister Sigurd
        Ibsen. Ibsen's dramas have a strong influence upon contemporary culture.</p>

    <h2>Early Life</h2>
    <p>Ibsen was born to Knud Ibsen (1797–1877) and Marichen Altenburg (1799–1869), into a well-to-do merchant family,
        in the small port town of Skien in Telemark county, a city which was noted for shipping timber. As he wrote in
        an 1882 letter to critic and scholar Georg Brandes, "my parents were members on both sides of the most respected
        families in Skien", explaining that he was closely related with "just about all the patrician families who then
        dominated the place and its surroundings", mentioning the families Paus, Plesner, von der Lippe, Cappelen and
        Blom.[12][13] Ibsen's grandfather, ship captain Henrich Ibsen (1765–1797), had died at sea in 1797, and Knud
        Ibsen was raised on the estate of ship-owner Ole Paus (1766–1855), after his mother Johanne, née Plesner
        (1770–1847), remarried. Knud Ibsen's half-brothers included lawyer and politician Christian Cornelius Paus,
        banker and ship-owner Christopher Blom Paus, and lawyer Henrik Johan Paus, who grew up with Ibsen's mother in
        the Altenburg home and after whom Henrik (Johan) Ibsen was named.


        Ibsen's grandmother Hedevig Altenburg, née Paus (cf. the character Hedvig in The Wild Duck)
        Knud Ibsen's paternal ancestors were ship captains of Danish origin, but he decided to become a merchant, and
        had some initial success. His marriage to Marichen Altenburg, a daughter of ship-owner Johan Andreas Altenburg
        (1763–1824) and Hedevig Christine Paus (1763–1848), was a successful match.[14][dubious – discuss] Theodore
        Jorgenson points out that "Henrik's ancestry [thus] reached back into the important Telemark family of Paus both
        on the father's and on the mother's side. Hedvig Paus must have been well known to the young dramatist, for she
        lived until 1848."[15] Henrik Ibsen was fascinated by his parents' "strange, almost incestuous marriage," and
        would treat the subject of incestuous relationships in several plays, notably his masterpiece Rosmersholm.[16]
        When Henrik Ibsen was around seven years old, however, his father's fortunes took a significant turn for the
        worse, and the family was eventually forced to sell the major Altenburg building in central Skien and move
        permanently to their small summer house, Venstøp, outside of the city.[17] Henrik's sister Hedvig would write
        about their mother: "She was a quiet, lovable woman, the soul of the house, everything to her husband and
        children. She sacrificed herself time and time again. There was no bitterness or reproach in her."[14][18] The
        Ibsen family eventually moved to a city house, Snipetorp, owned by Knud Ibsen's half-brother, wealthy banker and
        ship-owner Christopher Blom Paus.[14]

        His father's financial ruin would have a strong influence on Ibsen's later work; the characters in his plays
        often mirror his parents, and his themes often deal with issues of financial difficulty as well as moral
        conflicts stemming from dark secrets hidden from society. Ibsen would both model and name characters in his
        plays after his own family. A central theme in Ibsen's plays is the portrayal of suffering women, echoing his
        mother Marichen Altenburg; Ibsen's sympathy with women would eventually find significant expression with their
        portrayal in dramas such as A Doll's House and Rosmersholm.[14]

        At fifteen, Ibsen was forced to leave school. He moved to the small town of Grimstad to become an apprentice
        pharmacist and began writing plays. In 1846, when Ibsen was 18, he had a liaison with Else Sophie Jensdatter
        Birkedalen which produced a son, Hans Jacob Hendrichsen Birkdalen, whose upbringing Ibsen paid for until the boy
        was fourteen, though Ibsen never saw Hans Jacob. Ibsen went to Christiania (later renamed Kristiania and then
        Oslo) intending to matriculate at the university. He soon rejected the idea (his earlier attempts at entering
        university were blocked as he did not pass all his entrance exams), preferring to commit himself to writing. His
        first play, the tragedy Catilina (1850), was published under the pseudonym "Brynjolf Bjarme", when he was only
        22, but it was not performed. His first play to be staged, The Burial Mound (1850), received little attention.
        Still, Ibsen was determined to be a playwright, although the numerous plays he wrote in the following years
        remained unsuccessful.[19] Ibsen's main inspiration in the early period, right up to Peer Gynt, was apparently
        the Norwegian author Henrik Wergeland and the Norwegian folk tales as collected by Peter Christen Asbjørnsen and
        Jørgen Moe. In Ibsen's youth, Wergeland was the most acclaimed, and by far the most read, Norwegian poet and
        playwright.

    <h2>Life and Writings</h2>
    <p>He spent the next several years employed at Det norske Theater (Bergen), where he was involved in the production
        of more than 145 plays as a writer, director, and producer. During this period, he published five new, though
        largely unremarkable, plays. Despite Ibsen's failure to achieve success as a playwright, he gained a great deal
        of practical experience at the Norwegian Theater, experience that was to prove valuable when he continued
        writing.

        Ibsen returned to Christiania in 1858 to become the creative director of the Christiania Theatre. He married
        Suzannah Thoresen on 18 June 1858 and she gave birth to their only child Sigurd on 23 December 1859. The couple
        lived in very poor financial circumstances and Ibsen became very disenchanted with life in Norway. In 1864, he
        left Christiania and went to Sorrento in Italy in self-imposed exile. He didn't return to his native land for
        the next 27 years, and when he returned to it he was a noted, but controversial, playwright.

        His next play, Brand (1865), brought him the critical acclaim he sought, along with a measure of financial
        success, as did the following play, Peer Gynt (1867), to which Edvard Grieg famously composed incidental music
        and songs. Although Ibsen read excerpts of the Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard and traces of the latter's
        influence are evident in Brand, it was not until after Brand that Ibsen came to take Kierkegaard seriously.
        Initially annoyed with his friend Georg Brandes for comparing Brand to Kierkegaard, Ibsen nevertheless read
        Either/Or and Fear and Trembling. Ibsen's next play Peer Gynt was consciously informed by Kierkegaard.[20][21]

        With success, Ibsen became more confident and began to introduce more and more of his own beliefs and judgements
        into the drama, exploring what he termed the "drama of ideas". His next series of plays are often considered his
        Golden Age, when he entered the height of his power and influence, becoming the center of dramatic controversy
        across Europe.[citation needed]


        Ibsen photographed in Dresden c. 1870
        Ibsen moved from Italy to Dresden, Germany, in 1868, where he spent years writing the play he regarded as his
        main work, Emperor and Galilean (1873), dramatizing the life and times of the Roman emperor Julian the Apostate.
        Although Ibsen himself always looked back on this play as the cornerstone of his entire works, very few shared
        his opinion, and his next works would be much more acclaimed. Ibsen moved to Munich in 1875 and began work on
        his first contemporary realist drama The Pillars of Society, first published and performed in 1877.[22] A Doll's
        House followed in 1879. This play is a scathing criticism of the marital roles accepted by men and women which
        characterized Ibsen's society.

        Ghosts followed in 1881, another scathing commentary on the morality of Ibsen's society, in which a widow
        reveals to her pastor that she had hidden the evils of her marriage for its duration. The pastor had advised her
        to marry her fiancé despite his philandering, and she did so in the belief that her love would reform him. But
        his philandering continued right up until his death, and his vices are passed on to their son in the form of
        syphilis. The mention of venereal disease alone was scandalous, but to show how it could poison a respectable
        family was considered intolerable.[citation needed]

        In An Enemy of the People (1882), Ibsen went even further. In earlier plays, controversial elements were
        important and even pivotal components of the action, but they were on the small scale of individual households.
        In An Enemy, controversy became the primary focus, and the antagonist was the entire community. One primary
        message of the play is that the individual, who stands alone, is more often "right" than the mass of people, who
        are portrayed as ignorant and sheeplike. Contemporary society's belief was that the community was a noble
        institution that could be trusted, a notion Ibsen challenged. In An Enemy of the People, Ibsen chastised not
        only the conservatism of society, but also the liberalism of the time. He illustrated how people on both sides
        of the social spectrum could be equally self-serving. An Enemy of the People was written as a response to the
        people who had rejected his previous work, Ghosts. The plot of the play is a veiled look at the way people
        reacted to the plot of Ghosts. The protagonist is a physician in a vacation spot whose primary draw is a public
        bath. The doctor discovers that the water is contaminated by the local tannery. He expects to be acclaimed for
        saving the town from the nightmare of infecting visitors with disease, but instead he is declared an 'enemy of
        the people' by the locals, who band against him and even throw stones through his windows. The play ends with
        his complete ostracism. It is obvious to the reader that disaster is in store for the town as well as for the
        doctor.

        As audiences by now expected, Ibsen's next play again attacked entrenched beliefs and assumptions; but this
        time, his attack was not against society's mores, but against overeager reformers and their idealism. Always an
        iconoclast, Ibsen was equally willing to tear down the ideologies of any part of the political spectrum,
        including his own.[citation needed]

        The Wild Duck (1884) is by many considered Ibsen's finest work, and it is certainly the most complex. It tells
        the story of Gregers Werle, a young man who returns to his hometown after an extended exile and is reunited with
        his boyhood friend Hjalmar Ekdal. Over the course of the play, the many secrets that lie behind the Ekdals'
        apparently happy home are revealed to Gregers, who insists on pursuing the absolute truth, or the "Summons of
        the Ideal". Among these truths: Gregers' father impregnated his servant Gina, then married her off to Hjalmar to
        legitimize the child. Another man has been disgraced and imprisoned for a crime the elder Werle committed.
        Furthermore, while Hjalmar spends his days working on a wholly imaginary "invention", his wife is earning the
        household income.[citation needed]

        Ibsen displays masterful use of irony: despite his dogmatic insistence on truth, Gregers never says what he
        thinks but only insinuates, and is never understood until the play reaches its climax. Gregers hammers away at
        Hjalmar through innuendo and coded phrases until he realizes the truth; Gina's daughter, Hedvig, is not his
        child. Blinded by Gregers' insistence on absolute truth, he disavows the child. Seeing the damage he has
        wrought, Gregers determines to repair things, and suggests to Hedvig that she sacrifice the wild duck, her
        wounded pet, to prove her love for Hjalmar. Hedvig, alone among the characters, recognizes that Gregers always
        speaks in code, and looking for the deeper meaning in the first important statement Gregers makes which does not
        contain one, kills herself rather than the duck in order to prove her love for him in the ultimate act of
        self-sacrifice. Only too late do Hjalmar and Gregers realize that the absolute truth of the "ideal" is sometimes
        too much for the human heart to bear.[citation needed]


        Letter from Ibsen to his English reviewer and translator Edmund Gosse: "30.8.[18]99. Dear Mr. Edmund Gosse! It
        was to me a hearty joy to receive your letter. So I will finally personally meet you and your wife. I am at home
        every day in the morning until 1 o'clock. I am happy and surprised at your excellent Norwegian! Your amicably
        obliged Henrik Ibsen."
        Late in his career, Ibsen turned to a more introspective drama that had much less to do with denunciations of
        society's moral values and more to do with the problems of individuals. In such later plays as Hedda Gabler
        (1890) and The Master Builder (1892), Ibsen explored psychological conflicts that transcended a simple rejection
        of current conventions. Many modern readers, who might regard anti-Victorian didacticism as dated, simplistic or
        hackneyed, have found these later works to be of absorbing interest for their hard-edged, objective
        consideration of interpersonal confrontation. Hedda Gabler is probably Ibsen's most performed play,[citation
        needed] with the title role regarded as one of the most challenging and rewarding for an actress even in the
        present day. Hedda Gabler and A Doll's House center on female protagonists whose almost demonic energy proves
        both attractive and destructive for those around them, and while Hedda has a few similarities with the character
        of Nora in A Doll's House, many of today's audiences and theatre critics[who?] feel that Hedda's intensity and
        drive are much more complex and much less comfortably explained than what they view as rather routine feminism
        on the part of Nora.[citation needed]

        Ibsen had completely rewritten the rules of drama with a realism which was to be adopted by Chekhov and others
        and which we see in the theatre to this day. From Ibsen forward, challenging assumptions and directly speaking
        about issues has been considered one of the factors that makes a play art rather than entertainment. His works
        were brought to an English-speaking audience, largely thanks to the efforts of William Archer and Edmund Gosse.
        These in turn had a profound influence on the young James Joyce who venerates him in his early autobiographical
        novel "Stephen Hero". Ibsen returned to Norway in 1891, but it was in many ways not the Norway he had left.
        Indeed, he had played a major role in the changes that had happened across society. Modernism was on the rise,
        not only in the theatre, but across public life.[citation needed]

        Ibsen intentionally obscured his influences. However, asked later what he had read when he wrote Catiline, Ibsen
        replied that he had read only the Danish Norse saga-inspired Romantic tragedian Adam Oehlenschläger and Ludvig
        Holberg, "the Scandinavian Molière". [BBC Radio 4's in Our Time from Thursday, 31 May 2018

    <h2>Death</h2>
    <p>On 23 May 1906, Ibsen died in his home at Arbins gade 1 in Kristiania (now Oslo)[23] after a series of strokes in
        March 1900. When, on 22 May, his nurse assured a visitor that he was a little better, Ibsen spluttered his last
        words "On the contrary" ("Tvertimod!"). He died the following day at 2:30 pm.[24]

        Ibsen was buried in Vår Frelsers gravlund ("The Graveyard of Our Savior") in central Oslo.

        Centenary
        The 100th anniversary of Ibsen's death in 2006 was commemorated with an "Ibsen year" in Norway and other
        countries.[25][26][27] This year the homebuilding company Selvaag also opened Peer Gynt Sculpture Park in Oslo,
        Norway, in Henrik Ibsen's honour, making it possible to follow the dramatic play Peer Gynt scene by scene. Will
        Eno's adaptation of Ibsen's Peer Gynt, titled Gnit, had its world premiere at the 37th Humana Festival of New
        American Plays in March 2013.[28]

        On 23 May 2006, The Ibsen Museum in Oslo reopened to the public the house where Ibsen had spent his last eleven
        years, completely restored with the original interior, colors, and decor.[29]</p>
